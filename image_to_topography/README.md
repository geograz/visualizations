"image_to_topography.py" is an application that converts images into topographies. The topographies can either be visualized directly as a contour plot, or they can be exported as a point cloud.

The primary elevation data from "test.jpg" originates from the 10m digital elevation model provided freely by Land Tirol:

"Digitales Gel√§ndemodell Tirol, 10m (GeoTiff, EPSG: 31254)"
